The club was formed to promote the art of dance to K-State students and
the surrounding community through lessons, special events, and social
dancing. Our mission is to encourage people of all ages and backgrounds
to learn, enjoy and share the experience of dancing. Whether you've
danced all your life or have no dance experience at all, we welcome you
to KSU Swing & Salsa!
